When looking at this we can find how dangerous A QB is while also looking at how a receiver effects them in the passing game.

When looking at this you find that he is on the lower end of the completion percentage while his team does not help him with him being 4th among these QB’s with skilled player struggling with drops. Overall this just shows us that he is around the middle when it comes to completion percent while having some problems with drops.\n\n\nCode\ncolor_drops &lt;- \"red\"  \ncolor_comp &lt;- \"green\"   \ncolor_love &lt;- \"gold\" \n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(qb_plot1_scaled, aes(y = qb_name_fct)) +\n  geom_segment(\n    aes(x = scaled_drops, xend = comp_perc, yend = qb_name_fct), color = \"#cccccc\", size = 1\n  ) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = scaled_drops), color = color_drops, size = 3) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = comp_perc), color = color_comp, size = 3) +\n\n  geom_point(\n    data = subset(qb_plot1_scaled, player_name_std == \"Jordan Love\"), aes(x = scaled_drops), color = color_love, size = 4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = subset(qb_plot1_scaled, player_name_std == \"Jordan Love\"), aes(x = comp_perc), color = color_love, size = 4\n  ) +\n\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = comp_perc, label = paste0(round(comp_perc, 1), \"%\")), \n    color = color_comp, size = 3, hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1\n  ) +\n\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = scaled_drops, label = total_team_drops), \n    color = color_drops, size = 3, hjust = -1.5, vjust = -.5\n  ) +\n\n  labs(\n    title = \"QB Team Performance vs. Drop Difficulty (2023-2024 Combined)\",\n    subtitle = \"Completion % (Green) vs. Total Team Drops (Red) for Starting Quarterbacks\",\n caption = \"By: Wes Erickson | Source: nflverse package and the NFL box score Data Repository.(2023, 2024 seasons)\",\n    x = \"Performance Scale (Left: Total Drops | Right: Completion %)\", \n    y = \"Quarterback\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(), plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")) +\n  xlim(min(qb_plot1_scaled$scaled_drops, na.rm = TRUE) - 1, max(qb_plot1_scaled$comp_perc, na.rm = TRUE) + 3)\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nCode\nprint(p1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final graph that we are going to look at is how Jordan Love would preform when he would have people out.

In 2025 Jordan Love has stayed more consistent as a passer while also limiting turnovers. So is Jordan Love a top 5 QB in the NFL not quite but if he keeps preforming he can end up there, but he is in the top 10."

    "text": "Many coaches call a timeout right before a kicker kicks a field-goal. Does this really do anything?\nIn the NFL many games come down to the last minute and a team could only need a field goal. At this point many coaches still have a timeout. So how does this affect a kicker can some do better and some do worse? Does this distance matter on the kick to determine how well a kicker might do?\nWe need to find the data for fieldgoals and search through to see if there was a timeout called before.

What we find is that there is evidence that “icing” a kicker does something, but a lot more data would be helpful for more support of this point.\n\n\nCode\n#  CHUNK: Beeswarm Plot \n\nbottom_kicker_labels &lt;- kicker_beeswarm_data |&gt;\n  filter(kicker_status == \"Iced Attempts\") |&gt;\n  arrange(success_per_100) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 3)\n\njitter_width_val &lt;- 0.2 \n\nchart_beeswarm &lt;- kicker_beeswarm_data |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = kicker_status, y = success_per_100, color = kicker_status)) +\n  \n  geom_point(\n      position = position_jitter(width = jitter_width_val, seed = 42),\n      size = 3.5, \n      alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n  \n  geom_text(\n      data = bottom_kicker_labels,\n      aes(label = kicker_player_name),\n      position = position_jitter(width = jitter_width_val, seed = 42), \n      vjust = 2,    \n      hjust = 0.5,  \n      color = \"black\", \n      size = 3.5\n  ) +\n  \n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"errorbar\", \n               aes(ymax = after_stat(y), ymin = after_stat(y)), \n               width = 0.5, linewidth = 1.2, color = \"black\") +\n  \n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"text\", \n               aes(label = round(after_stat(y), 1)),\n               vjust = -2, color = \"black\", size = 4.5, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  \n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Non-Iced Attempts\" = \"skyblue3\", \"Iced Attempts\" = \"firebrick\"),\n    guide = \"none\" # Hide legend as X-axis labels are clear\n  ) +\n  \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(50, 100)) +\n  \nlabs(\n  title = \"Kicker Success Rate Distribution: Iced vs. Non-Iced\",\n  subtitle = paste0(\"Each point is one kicker.

When we look at this we are able to see that the pressure effects every kicker differently. When you look at the graph you are able to see guys like Tyler Bass and Daniel Carlson who kick at a 60% rate when a timeout is called on them.\nIn the end we find that the longer the field goal gets the more the timeout seems to cause them to miss. We also find that some people take pressure better then others and finally that we need way more data if we really want a definitive answer on if “icing” the kicker does anything."
